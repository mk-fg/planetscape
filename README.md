planetscape
--------------------

Script to render network-related data to a world map (and optionally place it on
desktop).

A project of mine from a few years ago, imported from
[old fossil repo](http://fraggod.net/code/fossil/planetscape/).

In process of being converted from python + xplanet thing to a node-webkit app.
