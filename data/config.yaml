### Default (baseline) configuration parameters.
### DO NOT change this config, instead place overlay
###  one at a path specified as "extension" parameter instead.

# Which config (YAML) file to load next
# Can be used in configs which are already an extension of others
# Same paths encountered again or non-existing paths will be skipped
# Initial extension config here (and only here)
#  can be overidden by setting PSC_CONF env var
extension: ~/.planetscape.yaml

# Same as extension, but will be applied prior to this config file
# Processed before extensions, if both are present in the same file
